# metaLang

**metaLang** is a general-purpose low-level programming language created for educational purposes.
The compiler is kind of toyish, written in **C**, with a small number of dependencies and a simple design focused on clarity and learning.

## Features
- Written entirely in C
- Minimal dependencies
- Simple architecture for educational use
- Supports a growing subset of language features

### Macro features
metaLang supports object-like and function-like macros, like C, but with few extra features. Function-like macros are followed with brackets so it's much more convenient to write them.

You can pass blocks of code in brackets and it will be parsed as a single argument, so it's allowed to write such macros:
```
macro do_while(expr, body) {
    while true {
        block body
        if !(expr) do break
    }
}
```

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/me7alix/metaLang.git
cd metaLang
```

2. Build the compiler:
```bash
make release -B
```

3. Compile and run an example:
```bash
./build/release/mtlc -I ./stdlib -o ./build/fib ./examples/fib.mtl
./build/fib
```

4. Add the environment variable `METALANG_HOME` with the path to the compiler. Now you don't have to provide the standard library path manually:
```bash
./build/release/mtlc -o ./build/fib ./examples/fib.mtl
./build/fib
```

## Examples
```
import "std.mtl"

fn main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n")
}
```
Check the [examples](https://github.com/me7alix/metaLang/tree/main/examples) directory to see what’s currently implemented.

## Platform Support

The compiler supports **Linux**, **Windows**, and **macOS**, and has been tested on Linux and Windows.

## Supported Assemblers

- [NASM](https://nasm.us) (amd64)
- GAS (aarch64)
